1. Props are used to pass data from one component to another.
2. The state is a local data storage that is local to the component only and cannot be passed to other components.
3. The this.setState property is used to update the state values in the component.

Q- what is useState?
A-The  useState hook is a special function that takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array of two entries.  UseState encapsulate only singular value from the state, for multiple state need to have useState calls. 

Q-how map, filter and reduce work?
A- Map-It applies a given function on all the elements of the array and returns the updated array. It is the simpler and shorter code instead of a loop. 

filter- It filters the elements of the array that return false for the applied condition and returns the array which contains elements that satisfy the applied condition.

Reduce - It reduces all the elements of the array to a single value by repeatedly applying a function. It is an alternative of using a loop and updating the result for every scanned element.
