/* Descendant combinator  */
.parent-element .child-element {
  /* Styles applied to child elements */
}



/* Child combinator (>): */
.parent-element > .child-element {
  /* Styles applied to direct child elements */
}


/* Adjacent sibling combinator (+):  */
.element + .sibling-element {
  /* Styles applied to the adjacent sibling element */
}



/* General sibling combinator (~): */
.element ~ .sibling-element {
  /* Styles applied to all sibling elements that come after the specified element */
}
