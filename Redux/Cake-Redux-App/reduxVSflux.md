# Redux vs Flux

Redux and Flux are both state management libraries used in JavaScript applications, but they have some key differences:

## Conceptual Differences
- **Flux**: Flux is an architecture pattern introduced by Facebook for managing application state. It follows unidirectional data flow, where actions flow through a central dispatcher to update stores, which then update views.
- **Redux**: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It is heavily influenced by Flux but simplifies the concepts by having a single store and using pure functions called reducers to manage state updates.

## Store Management
- **Flux**: Flux allows multiple stores to manage different parts of the application state. Each store has its own responsibility and can register callbacks with the dispatcher to receive actions.
- **Redux**: Redux uses a single store that holds the entire application state. This centralized approach makes it easier to manage and reason about the state.

## Updates and Immutability
- **Flux**: In Flux, stores are responsible for updating their own state based on received actions. To ensure immutability, developers usually create a new copy of the state in each store update.
- **Redux**: Redux enforces immutability and pure functions. Reducers, which update the state, always return a new state object instead of modifying the existing state. This promotes predictable state updates and time-travel debugging.

## Middleware Support
- **Flux**: Flux itself doesn't provide built-in middleware support. Developers have the freedom to implement middleware or utilities to enhance the Flux architecture.
- **Redux**: Redux has built-in middleware support, allowing developers to apply additional logic and side effects to the dispatching process. Middleware, such as redux-thunk or redux-saga, can intercept actions before they reach the reducers.

Overall, Redux can be seen as a more opinionated and simplified implementation of the Flux architecture. It provides a predictable state container with a single store, emphasizes immutability and pure functions, and offers built-in middleware support. Redux has gained popularity due to its simplicity, ease of use, and powerful developer tools.
