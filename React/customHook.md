## Common Use Cases for Custom Hooks in React

Custom hooks in React provide a way to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across different components. They can solve common problems such as managing state, handling side effects, and abstracting complex functionality in components. Here are some common use cases for custom hooks:

1. **State Management**: Custom hooks can help manage stateful logic in a reusable way. You can create custom hooks to handle form state, authentication state, or any other complex state management needs.

2. **Side Effects**: Custom hooks are useful for handling side effects like making API calls, subscribing to events, or managing timers. They encapsulate the side effect logic, promoting code reusability and keeping components focused on UI rendering.

3. **Abstracting Complex Functionality**: Custom hooks can abstract away complex functionality, making it easier to use in components. They provide a convenient way to reuse complex algorithms or specific features without exposing the implementation details.

By using custom hooks, you can improve the modularity and reusability of your codebase. They promote code organization, reduce duplication, and allow for easy sharing of logic between components.

### Creating a Custom Hook

To create a custom hook, follow these steps:

1. Define a function that starts with the prefix "use" to indicate that it's a hook.
2. Inside the hook function, use built-in hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, or other custom hooks as needed.
3. Define the state and logic specific to your use case within the hook.
4. Return the necessary values, functions, or data that needs to be accessed by components using the hook.

By adhering to the rules of hooks and using the custom hook in your components, you can leverage the encapsulated logic and solve common problems related to state management, side effects, and complex functionality abstraction.
