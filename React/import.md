## Importing All Named Exports in a React Application

To import all named exports from a module in a React application, you can use the `* as` syntax along with the module name. This allows you to import all the exports from the module and access them through a single object.

### Example

Let's say you have a file called `colors.js` that exports several color constants:

```javascript
// colors.js
export const RED = 'red';
export const BLUE = 'blue';
export const GREEN = 'green';
```


```javascript
import * as colors from './colors';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 style={{ color: colors.RED }}>Hello, React!</h1>
      <p style={{ backgroundColor: colors.BLUE, color: colors.GREEN }}>
        This is a colored paragraph.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
