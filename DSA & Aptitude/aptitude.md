# Aptitude Questions

## Question 1
A man fell into a well. The well is 30 meters deep. In a day, he can climb only 4 meters but slips down 3 meters. How many days would he take to come out of the well?

## Answer 1
To calculate the number of days it would take for the man to come out of the well, we need to determine the net progress he makes each day. The net progress is the difference between the distance he climbs (4 meters) and the distance he slips down (3 meters). 

Net progress per day = Climb distance - Slip distance = 4 meters - 3 meters = 1 meter.

Since the well is 30 meters deep, the man needs to cover a total distance of 30 meters. 

Number of days = Total distance / Net progress per day = 30 meters / 1 meter = 30 days.

Therefore, it would take the man 30 days to come out of the well.

## Question 2
A mother calls her two children, a boy and a girl, to play without getting dirty. However, while playing, both children get mud on their foreheads. The mother says, "At least one of you has a muddy forehead." She then asks the children to answer "Yes" or "No" to the question, "Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?". The mother asks this question twice. What will the children answer each time this question is asked, assuming that a child can see whether his/her sibling has a muddy forehead but cannot see his or her own forehead? Assume both the children are honest, and the children answer each question simultaneously.

## Answer 2
Let's consider the scenario where both children have muddy foreheads. In this case, each child can see the mud on their sibling's forehead but cannot see their own. 

When the mother asks the question, "Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?", both children will answer "No". This is because even though they can see the mud on their sibling's forehead, they cannot determine whether their own forehead is muddy.

When the question is asked for the second time, the children will give the same answer, "No", because the situation and their knowledge about their own foreheads have not changed.

Therefore, both children will answer "No" to the question each time it is asked.

## Question 3
A man is allocated a task. He doubles the task done every day. If the man completely does the task in 18 days, how many days did it take for the man to complete 25% of the task?

## Answer 3
Let's assume the task can be represented by a value of 1. On the first day, the man completes 1/18th of the task. 

The task completed on each subsequent day can be represented as follows:

Day 1: 1/18
Day 2: 2/18 (doubled the previous day's progress)
Day 3: 4/18
Day 4: 8/18
...
Day 18: 1 (completed the entire task)

To determine the number of days it took for the man to complete 25% of the task, we need to find the day when the cumulative progress reaches 1/4.

Cumulative progress on each day:
Day 1: 1/18
Day 2: 3/18
Day 3: 7/18
Day 4: 15/18
Day 5: 31/18 (more than 1/4)

Therefore, it took the man 5 days to complete 25% of the task.

## Question 4
There are three ants sitting on three corners of a triangle. All ants randomly pick a direction and start moving along the edge of the triangle. What is the probability that any two ants collide?

## Answer 4
To calculate the probability of two ants colliding, we need to consider all possible scenarios where the ants move in opposite directions. 

Each ant has two possible directions to choose from, resulting in a total of 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. Out of these combinations, there are 3 scenarios where two ants will collide:

1. Ant 1 moves clockwise, Ant 2 moves counterclockwise, Ant 3 moves clockwise.
2. Ant 1 moves counterclockwise, Ant 2 moves clockwise, Ant 3 moves counterclockwise.
3. Ant 1 moves clockwise, Ant 2 moves counterclockwise, Ant 3 moves counterclockwise.

Therefore, the probability of any two ants colliding is 3 out of 8, which can be simplified to 3/8.

## Question 5
You are blindfolded, and 10 coins are placed in front of you on the table. You are allowed to touch the coins but cannot tell which way up they are by feel. You are told that there are 5 coins head up and 5 coins tail up but not which ones are which. Can you make two piles of coins, each with the same number of heads up? You can flip the coins any number of times.

## Answer 5
Yes, it is possible to make two piles of coins with the same number of heads up. Here's how:

1. Divide the 10 coins into two groups of 5 coins each.
2. Flip all the coins in one of the groups.
3. Now, in each group, there will be a random number of heads up and tails up coins. Let's say Group A has a(x) heads up and b(y) tails up, and Group B has c(x) heads up and d(y) tails up.
4. Take Group A and remove a(x) coins from it.
5. Take Group B and remove d(y) coins from it.
6. Combine the remaining coins from Group A and Group B. Now, you will have (5 - a(x)) + (5 - d(y)) = (10 - a(x) - d(y)) coins.
7. This new combined group of coins will have the same number of heads up as tails up because you removed the same number of heads up and tails up coins from Group A and Group B.
8. Therefore, you have successfully made two piles of coins with the same number of heads up.

## Question 6
A patch of lily pads covers an area within a lake, and the patch doubles its size every day. If it takes 48 days for the lilies to cover the entire lake, how long does it take to cover half the lake?

## Answer 6
Since the patch of lily pads doubles in size every day, we can determine the number of days it takes to cover half the lake by counting the number of times the patch needs to double to reach that size.

If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, then it takes 47 days for the patch to cover half the lake. This is because on the 47th day, the patch would be half the size of the lake, and on the 48th day, it would double in size to cover the entire lake.

Therefore, it takes 47 days for the lilies to cover half the lake.

## Question 7
In a country, all families want a boy. They keep having babies until a boy is born. What is the expected ratio of boys and girls in the country?

## Answer 7
To determine the expected ratio of boys and girls in the country, we need to consider the probability of having a boy or a girl in each birth.

The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, which is 1/2 or 0.5. Therefore, in each birth, there is a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.

Since families keep having babies until a boy is born, the number of births can vary. However, on average, the number of births required until a boy is born is 2. Therefore, let's consider two births:

1. Boy (B) - Girl (G)
2. Boy (B)

In this scenario, we have one boy and one girl. The ratio of boys to girls is 1:1.

Considering all possible combinations, the expected ratio of boys to girls remains 1:1.

Therefore, the expected ratio of boys and girls in the country is 1:1.
